# Aspergillus fumigatus MultiProject Population Genomics

Generalized dataset collection and analysis for population genomics of A. fumigatus. 
This separates the alignment / read processing to generate g.vcf files as well as extract unmapped reads and assembly of these into one set of folders (*align* folder).
The genotyping and data analyses are then amalgamation of combinations of strain g.vcf files selected by user to enable different clade-level and global analyses (*genotype* folder).

As the data are too large to store in Github this is only an archive of scripts and sample lists for the time being.
